# Augment.js

Augment.js is a library that brings JavaScript 1.8.5 to any browser.  It does this by augmenting built in types like `Array` and `Object`.

It combines the code snippets supplied by [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) for implementing methods using the exact algorithms specified in ECMA specifications.

For documentation and usage see the [Augment.js](http://augmentjs.com) docs site.

## Credits

Thanks to Mozilla for doing most of the hard work by sharing pure JavaScript implementations for these methods on their website.
